                        <h2>JOURNEY</h2>
                        <P>I have been working in the shipping industry for over 14 years, gaining experience in
                            operations, customer service, and process management. My interest in coding began when I
                            started using VBA to automate repetitive tasks and simplify daily workflows. That early
                            exposure sparked a passion for building tools that solve real-world problems.</P>
                        <p>In April 2024, I officially began self-studying to become a full stack web developer. I
                            dedicated time outside of work to learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and backend
                            technologies, all with the goal of transitioning into a tech-focused role.</p>
                        <p>Recently, I successfully made that transition — stepping into a Software Engineer role within
                            the shipping industry. I'm now using my knowledge to build internal tools, streamline
                            operations, and support my team through automation and innovation.</p>
                        <p> goal is to grow as a developer and build useful, meaningful tools that improve the way
                            people work. I find genuine joy in creating automation that makes life easier for my
                            colleagues — and that’s what keeps me learning and building every day.</p>

                        <h2>HOBBIES & INTERESTS</h2>
                        <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me gaming — I’m a big fan of Stardew Valley, Zelda,
                            and Diablo. I also love reading; for fun, I gravitate toward fantasy novels, and for
                            personal growth, I enjoy books that build knowledge and inspire new ideas.</p>
                        <p>Travel is another big passion of mine. I’ve visited England, various parts of Europe, Fiji,
                            Bali, and China (for work), and I was born and raised in New Zealand. Next on the list is
                            South Korea and Japan in April 2025 — I’m beyond excited!</p>
                        <p>Outside of solo hobbies, I enjoy catching up with friends whenever I can. Whether it’s a
                            games night, a coffee catch-up, or just good conversation, connection is always something I
                            value.</p>
